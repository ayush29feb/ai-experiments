# General Adversarial Networks

Implementation of a simple GAN trained on the classical MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

## Experiments
In order to gain a better understanding of how GANs behave with different G & D networks with various hyperparameters, I will perform a number of experiments. I will log the experiments results in this readme.
